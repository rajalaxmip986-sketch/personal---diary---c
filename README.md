A Dairy Project in C is a console-based management system used to store and manage dairy records. The program uses structures and functions to add, view, update, search and delete milk-related data. It is compiled using a C compiler like GCC or Turbo C, and run using the run command. The user interacts through a menu-driven interface, enters data, and the program displays results such as successful insertion or update. File handling is used when records must be stored permanently.
